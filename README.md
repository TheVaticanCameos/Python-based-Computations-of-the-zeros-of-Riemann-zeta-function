# Python-based verification of Riemann hypothesis and computation of the zeros of zeta function
This repository is a project to compute the zeros of Riemann zeta function and verify the Riemann Hypothesis in a numerical sense. It combines the advantages of two different methods to calculate the zeros in segments.

For detail, please see **README, Chinese version**.
